/**
 * A whole notebook as ONE file.
 *
 * A note project is a directory under QStandardPaths::AppDataLocation, which is the right shape
 * while it is being written to -- a page save rewrites one small ink file instead of the whole
 * notebook -- and the wrong shape the moment it has to leave the device. A directory cannot be
 * mailed, put on a USB stick or handed to another application, so this is the transport form:
 * the same tree, in a plain ZIP, at the same relative paths, in one file.
 *
 *   manifest.json        the project manifest, byte for byte as it is on disk
 *   <source>.pdf         the original bytes, at the name manifest.source records
 *   pages/pNNNN.kra      ink only, as in the project
 *   thumbs/pNNNN.png     the page previews
 *   bundle.json          the index: what this file carries, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * The archive is written with KZip, which is the KArchive code PdfInkLoader already reads a .kra
 * with: an existing plugin dependency that works on Android, so the bundle costs no new one. It is
 * a plain ZIP and nothing else -- \c unzip opens it, and a zip of a project directory made by hand
 * (without bundle.json) is accepted too.
 *
 * The extension is .pnb. It is a guess: the project name is still provisional, and the extension
 * only has to be one the file managers do not already claim for something else. Nothing in the
 * format depends on it; inspect() and extract() read any name.
 *
 * Reading is the dangerous half. An archive is attacker-controlled input, so extract() refuses to
 * write anything until every entry has been checked: a path that is absolute or climbs out of the
 * destination (zip slip), a manifest from a schema this build does not know, a source whose bytes
 * do not match the checksum the manifest recorded, a manifest naming a page or thumb the archive
 * does not carry, and an archive that is truncated or edited. Entries that are not part of a
 * notebook are ignored and reported, never extracted because they happened to be in the file.
 *
 * Extraction is atomic: the notebook is rebuilt in a temporary directory beside the destination
 * and renamed into place, so a refusal leaves no half-written notebook behind and the destination
 * is never overwritten unless the caller asks for it.
