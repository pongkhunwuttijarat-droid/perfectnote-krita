/**
 * Which pages are allowed to stay open at once, and what has to happen before one of them goes.
 *
 * A page costs about 41 MB resident (measured across twelve pages), so a notebook cannot keep all
 * of them: without a bound, opening page 200 of a 500-page scan is the same as opening all of
 * them. The bound is the easy half. The half that loses work is what happens when the window is
 * full and the page that has to make room is the one the user just drew on.
 *
 * The policy is one page at a time, exactly:
 *
 *  - Pages are held in least-recently-used order. Opening a page that is already in the window
 *    just moves it to the front of the queue.
 *  - When opening a page would push the window past its capacity, the least recently used *clean*
 *    page is evicted. A clean page has nothing on it that is not already on disk, so dropping it
 *    costs only the render that opening it again will do anyway.
 *  - A page that is dirty -- it carries ink that is not on disk -- is never dropped. If every slot
 *    in the window is dirty, the least recently used one is *saved* first and only then evicted,
 *    so what leaves the window is on disk.
 *  - If that save fails, the eviction does not happen at all, the page that is open stays open,
 *    the new page is not opened, and open() reports why. Losing ink to make room is never an
 *    option; a page turn that cannot be completed safely is a failed page turn.
 *
 * The class is deliberately dependency-light: Qt's containers, a std::function for the save, and
 * nothing from the application. That is what lets the policy be exercised in ctest the way
 * PdfSessionManifest is, instead of only inside a running Krita, which is where the bug this
 * exists to prevent would otherwise hide.
 *
 * It is not a cache of page rasters. It is the bookkeeping that decides what may be closed; the
 * document and the render behind an open page belong to the caller.
