/**
 * Writes the source PDF again with the ink composited over it.
 *
 * The source is never rewritten: this is a PDF incremental update. Every original byte stays
 * where it was, and the overlay is added by appending a new content stream and *redefining the
 * existing page object* through the xref. That detail is the whole technique -- the page tree
 * already points at a fixed object number, so appending a brand new page object would simply
 * never be referenced. Because no original object is rewritten, the text of the source stays
 * extractable and the untouched pages stay untouched.
 *
 * The ink is placed in *page* space, so it rotates with the page rather than with the screen,
 * and a MediaBox that does not start at the origin needs no correction.
 *
 * The reader understands both cross reference forms: the classic xref table and the PDF 1.5
 * cross reference stream (/Type /XRef), including pages that live inside object streams
 * (/Type /ObjStm) with FlateDecode and PNG or TIFF predictors -- which is how browsers, Ghostscript
 * and most LaTeX output store their pages today. A construct it cannot read is refused with a
 * precise message instead of being written out as a file that only looks right: encrypted files,
 * stream filters other than FlateDecode, and unreadable page trees are refused, never guessed.
 *
 * Deliberately pure C++ with no renderer dependency, so the same code runs on desktop and on
 * Android, where there is no Poppler at all.
