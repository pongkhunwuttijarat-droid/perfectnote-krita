/**
 * Where each page of a strip sits inside the strip image.
 *
 * Pure geometry, separated from everything that builds or paints, because this is the part of
 * design B that has to be right and the part that can be tested without a canvas.
 *
 * The strip is vertical and its image size is fixed for a given scope: every slot is the same
 * cell, sized to the largest page in the notebook, and a page sits at the top of its own cell at
 * its own size. A fixed image size is the point -- rolling the window repaints the slot that goes
 * out of view rather than rebuilding the document, which is what makes a page turn cost a render
 * instead of a document and a view.
 *
 * Pages are laid out in page order, so the strip reads downwards, and the window is centred on
 * the active page as far as the ends of the notebook allow.

     * \a pages and \a rects are parallel lists, the same shape PdfPageNavigator keeps as
     * m_stripPages and m_stripRects; a page of -1 is skipped. Ties inside the gap resolve to the
     * first slot in order, so the answer never depends on the order the pages were visited in --
